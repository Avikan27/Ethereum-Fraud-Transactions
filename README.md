# Detecting Fraud Transactions on Ethereum Blockchain

This project focuses on studying and comparing the performance of various supervised machine learning models, such as decision trees, random forest, and gradient boosted trees, for detecting fraudulent transactions on the Ethereum blockchain. The analysis and model building were performed using RapidMiner.

## Business Understanding

Fraudulent transactions pose a significant risk in the world of cryptocurrencies, and Ethereum, being a popular blockchain platform, is not exempt from this threat. Detecting and preventing fraud is crucial for maintaining the integrity and security of the Ethereum network. This project aims to leverage machine learning techniques to identify fraudulent transactions effectively.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is a labeled dataset specifically prepared for fraud transaction detection on the Ethereum blockchain. It contains various features and labels indicating whether a transaction is fraudulent or not. The dataset is used for both data preparation and modeling stages.

## Data Preparation

The data preparation stage involved cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, and transforming the features to ensure compatibility with the machine learning models. Additionally, any necessary feature engineering techniques were applied to enhance the performance of the models.

## Data Modeling

Multiple supervised machine learning models, including decision trees, random forest, and gradient boosted trees, were implemented and evaluated. The models were trained on the prepared dataset and tested using appropriate evaluation metrics such as AUC, confusion matrix, and decision tree visualization. 

## Results

After comparing the performance of the different models, the random forest model emerged as the best performing model for detecting fraud transactions on the Ethereum blockchain. Its ability to effectively capture complex relationships in the data and handle high-dimensional feature spaces made it a suitable choice for this task.

## Conclusion

By leveraging the power of machine learning, specifically the random forest model, this project provides valuable insights and a robust solution for detecting fraudulent transactions on the Ethereum blockchain. This can greatly contribute to enhancing the security and trustworthiness of the Ethereum network.
